                                    <p>You may designate a beneficiary in your application or enrollment form. You may
                                        change your beneficiary at any time. To do so, you must send a signed and dated,
                                        written request to the policyholder using a form satisfactory to us. Your
                                        written request to change the beneficiary must be sent to the policyholder
                                        within 30 days of the date you sign such request.</p>

                                    <p>You do not need the beneficiary’s consent to make a change. When we receive the

                                        who survive you: your spouse, your child(ren), your parent(s), or your
