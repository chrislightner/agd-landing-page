                        <p><strong>Let us help find the right Long-Term Care insurance plan for you, so you can spend

                        <p>People are living longer these days, but as life expectancies increase, so does the risk of
                            serious health problems that could require long-term care. In fact, at retirement age, 70%
                            of Americans will need long-term care.<sup>1</sup> And with the
                            average cost for nursing home care in a semi-private room equating to more than $89,292 per
                            year, that could literally cost most or all of your life&rsquo;s savings.<sup>2</sup></p>

                        <p>Long-Term Care insurance may not be for everyone. But with soaring healthcare costs,
                            insurance restrictions and the need to stretch retirement savings through more years&hellip;
                            it&rsquo;s a good idea to seriously consider this valuable coverage while receiving a member
                            premium discount.</p>

                        <p>Hagan Insurance Group and Long-Term Care Resources work together to provide members
                            with a comprehensive long-term care program that gives members the stability and flexibility
